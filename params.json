{"name":"ag.granular.suite","tagline":"modular toolkit for granular sound synthesis and processing in Max\\MSP environment","body":"**ag.granular.suite** is a collection of Max/MSP patches for generalised granular sound processing written by Adrian Gierakowski using FTM/Gabor libraries (developed at IRCAM) and encapsulated as Jamoma modules. \r\n\r\nMain features include: \r\n* subsample accurate grain scheduling\r\n* multichannel output\r\n* granulation of multiple soundfiles or real time input buffers at the same time\r\n* with interpolation of two sources per grain\r\n* parameter randomisation and sequencing\r\n* control via OSC\r\n* preset management\r\n* preset interpolation\r\n\r\nIts modular architecture makes it possible to easily extend it with new algorithms for grain scheduling and parameter control.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
